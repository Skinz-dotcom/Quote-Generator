# Quote-Generator

Web app that that will randomly generate well known quotes from well known authors.

This app will fetch the quotes data from an API and store the info locally.

On load, we will get a new randomly selected quote and its author, then display it.

when we click the new quote button it will randomly select from the locally stored quotes, and display the new quote.

If you like the quote, you can tweet said quote by using the embedded tweet button.
This will open a new window in a new tab, and fill the tweet text as the quote and its author ready for you to tweet.

If the page is taking to long to fetch the data initially, it will display a loading indicator, until the quote is ready to be displayed.
